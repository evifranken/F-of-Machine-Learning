    "#### 1.1 Context \n",
    "At April 20, 1999 a school shooting and attempted bombing occured at a High School in Columbine, Colorado. It was the deadliest high school shooting in the US until 2018. Since then 'Columbine' has become a byword for school shootings. This heartbreaking massacre made a big impact on the whole world, but most importantly on the children who were exposed to the school shootings. More than 240,000 students have experienced gun violence at school since Columbine (Analysis | More than 240,000 Students Have Experienced Gun Violence at School since Columbine, 2018). Unfortunately, the federal government in the United States does not track school shootings. Therefore journalists from The Washington Post have spend a year determining how many children have ben effected and documented it into 1 dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 The research question\n",
    "<i>\"Given the relationship with the shooter, the school enrollment, whether the school had the resource of an officer and the shooting type how well can the casualties be predicted?\"</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 Practical relevance \n",
    "The dataset seems rich and contains many types of information. However there are a lot of variables that contain a lot of NaN's and there aren't a lot of entries (this is caused by the federal government that doesnt track these school shootings). It's not a lot, and it makes it a bit harder for machine learning, as I don't have a lot of data to choose from in order to make the best prediction. However I think its a very interesting (and a little grim as well) topic, so this will motivate me. Thus, I'll try to make the best out of it.\n",

Most values can be combined into one column. So student in summerschool can be merged into the value of just a student. Thus, I want to simplify this by using broader categories such as: parents, student and teachers. I will create a column of remaining values to combine the more random variables. This way I will only have a few columns which is better when I convert them into dummies."

We are mainly interested in the casualties, so it's good that these are a little better hower the recall of casualties needs to go up. And when the precision of non-casualties is so bad a lot of non-casualties will be casualties. And we actually need to catch these casualties accurately.\n",

    "When looking back at the proces of evaluating my prediction model, I made it hard for my self to choose a dataset with little entries. However I was able to at least evaluate and mess around with this data set in a sufficient way.\n",
    "\n",
    "So coming back to my research question:\n",
    "<i>\"Given the relationship with the shooter, the school enrollment, whether the school had the resource of an officer and the shooting type how well can the casualties be predicted?\"</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to this question would be, not well (YET!). We want to be able to help schools and government with predictions in order to ofcourse learn and prevent any of these horrible school shootings. Therefore we wanted to predict the casualties. The predicted casualties for my best model was by using the KNN model and using 3 neighbors. It gave me an accuracy of 76% a precision of 77% and a recall of 98%. However this is always in relation to prediction the non-casualties. The non-casualties had a very low recall, which made the predictions even less trustworthy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most remarkable finding of this research, was based on the analysis of the relationship between shootings and the resource to an officer + the shooter who was an officer. First I thought that it might had something to do with the enrollment, and that therefore the probability of having the involvement could be higher but this didn't show in the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the presentation my intention was to go back and see if it would make a difference when I would subset my dataset differently by adding different variables. However, I got some errors in the process. Due to limitations in time (1 afternoon) I didn't had the time to fix it and in order to make it work I decided to leave it like this and include it in a section for future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "So things I would look into in further research, was thus trying to subset the dataframe differently. I would want to have a look into variables as: day of the week, school type and low_grade, high_grade. As mentioned before I think ethnicities of the schools might have been variables of value, however at the beginning of this project I wanted to try and leave them out as the feeling of scoring on race didn't feel like a very ethical thing to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to look into including dummies for day of the week. This way I could quickly look into the correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![download.png](attachment:download.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation showed me some stronger correlations, but not in relation to the y-variable casualties. Unfortunately didn't had the time to look into it any further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just ending my discussion by thinking out loud: I use a lot of dummy variables. I ended up reading tonight about the dummy variable trap, though I could only find a connection so far to regression model. I wonder if this could have had an effect on my predictions as well. Something to look into thus."
